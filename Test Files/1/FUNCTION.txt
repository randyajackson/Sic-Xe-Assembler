.This program performs the operation BETA + GAMMA - ALPHA when ALPHA=1, BETA=2, and GAMMA=3
FUNCTION	START 100	.Load the program at memory location 100
ALPHA	WORD 1	.Define constant named ALPHA initialized to 1
BETA	WORD 2	.Define constant named BETA initialized to 2
GAMMA	WORD 3	.Define constant named GAMMA initialized to 3
	LDA BETA	.Load accumulator with 2
	ADD GAMMA	.Add 3 to accumulator
	SUB ALPHA	.Subtract 1 from accumulator
	STA RESULT	.Store 4 into the memory location RESULT
	LDA RESULT	.Load accumulator with 4
RESULT	RESW 1	.Reserve a word (118 breakpoint)
